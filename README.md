# Predictive Modeling – Real-World Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating predictive models using a real-world dataset. It demonstrates the transition from descriptive and inferential analysis to prediction, with an emphasis on interpretation and practical decision support.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Develop predictive models based on historical data  
- Generate predictions for unseen observations  
- Evaluate model performance and reliability  
- Communicate predictions along with assumptions and limitations  

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains real-world observations suitable for predictive analysis. Preprocessing steps were performed to clean the data, handle missing values, and prepare features for modeling.

## Methods Used
- Feature selection and data preprocessing  
- Predictive modeling techniques  
- Model evaluation and validation  
- Interpretation of predictions and model output  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Predictive modeling libraries  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Learnings
- Predictive models must be evaluated before being trusted  
- Interpretation is critical when communicating predictions  
- Assumptions and limitations should always accompany model results  

## Project Context
This project was completed as part of the **Master of Data Science & Analytics (MDSA)** program.
